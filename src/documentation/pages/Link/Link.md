# Link
Used to create a hyperlink to another location.

## Variants

### Default

{{> Link props=LinkModels.basic }}
--->

## States
This component has only the default state.

## Dependencies
This component has no dependencies on other components.

## Accessibility
Use the `title` attribute to provide additional text describing the link, if the link text itself is not descriptive enough.

## Notes
The Link inherits the font family, size, and weight of its parent element. This is why we have placed it within `.ms-font-m` wrapper in the sample above.
