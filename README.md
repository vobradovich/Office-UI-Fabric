#[Office UI Fabric](http://dev.office.com/fabric)

#####The front-end framework for building experiences for Office and Office 365.

Fabric is a responsive, mobile-first collection of styles and tools designed to make it quick and simple for you to create web experiences using the Office Design Language.

**Please note:** We are currently moving the components into their own repo as [Office UI Fabric JS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js). If you have any issues related to components or would like to submit a pull request, please do so there.
